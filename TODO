    M-x magit-status
    '?' (to get a list of actions you can do, nice help)
    'n' and 'p' to move to the next or previous section
    '+' and '-' to show more or less of the current section
    's' and 'u' to stage and unstage a chunk
    'c' to start the commit
        or instead you can use 'a' to ammend
    in the git log: 'r' to reword
    Next to learn: git logging
* multiple eshells at the same time
    and a shell with better color rendering (eg. git status)
* play with the emacs tutorial
    (Help->Emacs Tutorial)
    (C-h t)
* eshell vs ansi-term+fish
* learn to active some things in only some modes
    for example not current line highlight in eshell, but yes when coding
* what browser to use for documentation?
* relearn the keycombo to quickly switch between buffers
    faster than 'C-x b' when you want to see the last one used
* make text wrap in only the current buffer
    (M-x visual-line-mode)
* switch to a sliding down pager, instead of jumping from page to page
* matching parenthesis behaves weirdly in some Rust cases
    is there a better Rust mode?
* play with other packages listed in M-x package-list-packages
* get autocompletion
    maybe with smart-tab, but maybe there is something better
* CTAGS for GStreamer and MPU code? So we can jump to function definitions
* Try a twitter client in emacs
